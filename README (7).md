# VPN Setup and Usage

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Introduction
This project demonstrates setting up and using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect online privacy, encrypt internet traffic, and bypass geographical restrictions.

## Objectives
- Install and configure a free VPN (ProtonVPN Free).
- Connect to a VPN server and verify IP change.
- Understand VPN benefits and limitations.
- Answer VPN-related interview questions.

## Tools
- *VPN Client:* ProtonVPN (Free tier)
- *Verification:* https://whatismyipaddress.com
- *OS:* Windows 10/11 
## Steps Followed
1. *Sign Up* for a ProtonVPN free account on the official site.
2. *Download & Install* the ProtonVPN client for your OS.
3. *Connect* to the fastest free server (or any free location).
4. *Verify IP Change*
   - Note IP *before* connecting (whatismyipaddress.com).
   - Note IP *after* connecting (same site).
5. *Browse* normally to confirm everything works.


## Benefits of VPN
- Masks real IP and location.
- Encrypts traffic (protects against ISP/public Wi-Fi snooping).
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions.
- Adds a security layer on untrusted networks.

## Limitations of VPN
- Potential speed drop due to encryption/route.
- Some sites/services block VPN IP ranges.
- Free tiers have limited servers/bandwidth.
- Not complete anonymity (browser/device fingerprinting still exists).

## Conclusion 
- This project demonstrated how VPNs secure online activity by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses, while also highlighting their limitations in speed and server availability.
